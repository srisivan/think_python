# We can find which type a object is, by typing it in the type() command, like this::

type('Hello World!')            # Outputs 'str'
type(1234)                    	# Outputs 'int'
type(3.1456)                  	# Outputs 'float'
type('123456')                  # DOES NOT Output as 'int'. Outputs as 'str', as they are inside quotes
